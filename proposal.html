    <h1>Final Web Site Project Proposal</h1> 
    <ol><li>I will obtain information from organizations hosting events and meetups for people who use American Sign Language in the Southern California region. This website will list details related to the location, time, date, theme, cost, link to event, and a review after the event is over (if I, or someone I know can attend).</li>
    <li>American Sign Language users who live in the Southern California Area or planning on visiting the Southern California area.</li>
    <li>Audiences will rely on this website to provide information about events coming up that they may not know about because of their interest, location, and time to search for events. If the website grows in popularity, future plans for monetization might include organizations paying to be listed on the website to have high traffic be directed to their organization. As well as hosting my own events that gives back to the community that uses American Sign Language.</li>
    <li>I will find future events and browse through different social media platforms and network connections that I have made through ASL for events and meetups. I will inquire with the organization for their consent to list their information. I will obtain the event information and categorize the different events it based on interests. I will make an interactive discussion around the event so attendees can inquire with other people their personal questions (carpools, what to bring, advice from events passed (i.e. parking)). I will make an interactive calendar of events that can be downloaded to a smartphone as well as posted to social media sites such as, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail.</li>
    <li>American Sign Language is my first language so staying involved in the community is a big part of my life. Also I love parties, so this is a combination of 2-of my favorite things.</li>
