    <h1>About Me</h1> 
    <ol>
        <li>Hi, My name is Garnet Clarke and I have been a San Diego resident for 3 years. This is my final year at Mesa, and I am working hard to get my Associates this Spring 2017. I have been on the Dean’s List all the years I’ve spent here in the the San Diego Community College system and that is a very proud achievement for me.</li>
        <li>I am taking WEBD162 to fulfill my requirements in order to get my Associates in Web Development. I spent my summer trying to build my own website and it was clear, I needed to obtain more information. I am planning to get my career in the rapidly growing world of computers, and I am spending this semester and next determining where I fit.</li>
        <li>I am taking a mix of on-campus and online classes and they are all web related (WEB 169, WEB 153, MULT 121..etc..). In addition to taking 6 classes, I also work in pet care which is another great stress reliever because I get paid to work out and play with cute puppies and kitties.</li>
        <li>I like to spend my time staying active; involving myself in learning new skills (learning Spanish and the ukulele), tinkering with art and crafts, traveling, or cuddling with my kitty, Zivah, I love to stay busy.</li>
    </ol>
